Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
JavaScript: A high-level programming language for building web applications.
HTML: A markup language for creating web pages.
CSS: A style sheet language for styling web pages.
Challenges
One of the challenges faced in building this project was implementing the filtering logic to update the list of products based on the selected filters. To overcome this challenge, the React state was used to store the list of products and the selected filters, and the list of products was filtered based on the selected filters using the filter() method.

Another challenge was making the web application responsive and ensuring that it works on different devices and screen sizes. To overcome this challenge, media queries and flexible layout techniques were used to adjust the layout and styling of the web application based on the screen size and device type.

Future Improvements
Some possible improvements to this project include:

Adding pagination to the list of products to improve performance and reduce the amount of data displayed at once.
Adding a search bar to allow users to search for specific products based on keywords.
Adding the ability for users to sort the list of products based on different criteria, such as price, rating, or popularity.
